                    <h2>Building Teamwork: Mixed Reality Game for Developing Trust and Communication</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>  A mixed reality VR application task digitizing legos from a model in the real world, to a VR application, by the use of image processing and socket streaming.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tech Used/Competences Gained:</strong> Python for image processing, Unity/C# for scene creation of VR application, socket streaming for communication between Python and Unity/C#. </p>
                        
                    <p><strong>Program briefly explained:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The VR user has two Lego "statues" in front of them in a puzzle room and needs them to match. However they do not have any legos in possession, so they have to communicate with their partner.</li>
                        <li>The user not in VR is set in front of a lego plane and has to build the figure which the VR player tells them too. Since they are not in VR, they can only rely on verbal information given by the VR player.</li>
                        <li>Once both figures match, a door in the VR application opens and the VR player can progress.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>FoodFighters - Improving Memory Retention of Food Items through a Mobile Serious Game</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> An application made to reduce food waste via memory retention and gamification techniques.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tech Used/Competences Gained:</strong> Making applications in Android Studio. Creating "character" customizer and saving user made creations.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Take a picture of a food-fighter you wish to create.</li>
                        <li>Crop said photo by dragging finger around the entire food item. Confirm when you are happy with the crop.</li>
                        <li>Customize your food fighter with options for hands/feet/hair/eyes/mouth.</li>
                        <li>When customization is done, give the character a name.</li>
                         <li>Go into a 1 on 1 battle with a list of pre-set characters in the application.</li>

                    <h2>Bouncing Ball Traversal: A Target-Based Travel Technique For Vertical Travel</h2>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alternative teleportation method for virtual reality. Explored in association with the course "Spatial User Interfaces", but later implemented into a main project exploring user profiling in VR with the use of machine learning. </p>
                    <p><strong>Tech Used/Competences Gained:</strong> Unity/C#. As well gathering biometric data from VR applications for ML purposes.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The user picks up the ball and gauges what location they want to go to.</li>
                        <li>When the user has found their location. They have an option to "toggle" on the ball how many bounces it should do before teleportation.</li>
                        <li>The user throws the ball and gets teleported to the location next time the ball hits a ground plane. In which the process can be repeated.</li>
